# Constitution Update for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Summary

Updated the project constitution to align with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project requirements. The constitution now reflects the specific principles and constraints for this AI-native technical textbook project focused on ROS 2, digital twins, and humanoid robotics.

## Original Prompt

The user provided specific constitutional principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project:

- Spec-Driven Development with Spec-Kit Plus workflow
- Technical Accuracy focused on ROS 2 (rclpy), URDF, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac
- Modularity & Reusability with Claude Code Subagents
- Docusaurus-First Architecture for content generation
- Specific standards for RAG integration, auth & personalization, localization
- TypeScript frontend requirement and GitHub Pages deployment constraint

## Response

Created a comprehensive constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and updated the template files to align with the constitutional principles:

1. Created new constitution file with version 1.1.0
2. Updated plan-template.md to include constitutional compliance gates
3. Updated spec-template.md to include constitutional alignment requirements
4. Updated tasks-template.md to include constitutional compliance phase
