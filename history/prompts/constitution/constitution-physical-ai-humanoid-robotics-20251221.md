# Constitution Physical AI Humanoid Robotics

## Prompt
Create a Constitution document for a book about "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with specific requirements for Docusaurus 3.x, TypeScript, ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and RAG chatbot implementation.

## Response
Created a comprehensive Constitution document for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project with the following key elements:

- Core Principles: Frontend Framework (Docusaurus 3.x with TypeScript), Technical Accuracy (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac), Project Completeness (integrated RAG chatbot), Modularity for Reusability (Claude Code Subagents)
- Key Standards: Project structure in doc-book/, content location in doc-book/docs/, TypeScript code standards, 4-Module book structure, RAG stack specifications
- Constraints: Primary tools (Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code), Auth implementation (Better-Auth.com), Word count (5,000-7,000), Deployment compatibility (GitHub Pages)
- Success Criteria: Base functionality (deployed site with RAG chatbot) plus bonus points for Subagents, Auth, Personalization, Translation features
- Stakeholders: Learners, educators, developers
- Brand Voice: Technical yet approachable

Created the constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md with version 1.0.0.
