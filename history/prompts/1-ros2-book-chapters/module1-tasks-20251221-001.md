# Module 1 Tasks - ROS2 Book Chapters

## Summary

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Docusaurus Book Chapters, organizing the work into phases aligned with user stories and implementation requirements.

## Original Prompt

```
Reference Plan: Use the implementation roadmap from the current plan.

Goal: Break down the creation of 3 chapters and supporting code files in `doc-book/docs/module-1/`.

---

### Task Phases & Requirements:

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Sidebar Setup
- **Task 1.1:** Update `docusaurus.config.ts` or `sidebars.ts` to include the "Module 1" category.
- **Task 1.2:** Create the directory structure: `doc-book/docs/module-1/code-examples/` and `doc-book/docs/module-1/assets/`.

#### Phase 2: Content Generation (The Core Chapters)
- **Task 2.1: Chapter 1 Creation.** Generate `chapter-1-ros2-communication.md` covering Nodes, Topics, and Services with APA citations.
- **Task 2.2: Chapter 2 Creation.** Generate `chapter-2-python-agents.md` focusing on the rclpy Agent-Controller bridge.
- **Task 2.3: Chapter 3 Creation.** Generate `chapter-3-urdf-fundamentals.md` detailing humanoid robot modeling.

#### Phase 3: Code & Technical Assets
- **Task 3.1:** Create `publisher_subscriber_telemetry.py` using rclpy library standards.
- **Task 3.2:** Create `agent_controller_bridge.py` for Python AI logic integration.
- **Task 3.3:** Create `simple_humanoid.urdf` XML following humanoid robot skeleton standards.

#### Phase 4: UI & Compliance Check
- **Task 4.1:** Insert button placeholders at the top of each chapter: `<button>Personalize</button>` and `<button>Translate to Urdu</button>`.
- **Task 4.2:** Run a final word count check to ensure Module 1 meets the 1,600+ words per chapter target.
- **Task 4.3:** Verify build integrity with `npm run build` to ensure zero TypeScript errors.
```

## Response

Successfully created a comprehensive task breakdown in `.specify/specs/1-ros2-book-chapters/tasks.md` with the following structure:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Created directory structure and updated sidebar configuration
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - Created TypeScript components and placeholder files
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** - Implemented Chapter 1 on ROS 2 Communication with publisher/subscriber examples
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** - Implemented Chapter 2 on Python Agents with rclpy and agent-controller bridge
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** - Implemented Chapter 3 on URDF fundamentals with humanoid robot modeling
6. **Phase 6: Polish** - Added documentation, validation, and build checks

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task includes specific file paths and clear descriptions. The implementation strategy supports both MVP-first delivery and parallel team execution as requested.
